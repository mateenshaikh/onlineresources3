To populate content quickly, you'll have to look in `/content` folder and the appropriate subfolder. If you're creating a new (sub)folder remember to create a new `_index.md`. If you have several pages in that folder they obviously won't all be named this, but `_index.md` will be the page that loads when you click on the folder (from the crumbs), you don't directly access it from the menu. If you copy other `_index.md` files it'll just be a table of contents for the folder. It's usually not accessed much.

Each page should ultimately be written as a markdown file. Use all the usual markdown you're used to, plus the additional info that's available in this theme, outlined in Content Management.
