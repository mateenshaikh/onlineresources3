This theme is a little more involved, as my first extension. The recommendations on how to achieve things likely aren't the most efficient all the time but hopefully they'll get the job done.

The bar has a listed set of Depth X folders to show how to create nested elements in the menu. It's fairly straightforward when you look in the `/content` menu. Each folder needs a `_index.md` (which can be created by some other means) in order to render a page.
