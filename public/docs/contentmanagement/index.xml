        <description>Regular code The coolest thing (to me) about the original zdoc theme, is how the coding renders. A variety of common languages are included but not all of them. You can download more but it does bloat the site so only take the ones you think you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use. If you want to use (any) code and show it you&amp;rsquo;ll use the following template
```language line of code 1 line of code 2 line of code 3 ```  if you specify a recognzied language, the appropriate syntax highlighting is used.</description>
