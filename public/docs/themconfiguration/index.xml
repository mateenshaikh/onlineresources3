        <description>This theme is a little more involved, as my first extension. The recommendations on how to achieve things likely aren&amp;rsquo;t the most efficient all the time but hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll get the job done.
The bar has a listed set of Depth X folders to show how to create nested elements in the menu. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward when you look in the /content menu. Each folder needs a _index.md (which can be created by some other means) in order to render a page.</description>

        <description>Most of the configuration is determined through files that are some flavour of markup language (TOML/YAML).
The file /content/config.yaml has some of the settings for the page. Besides things like the title, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to want to modify this since it&amp;rsquo;s all very normal, rather than personal choices. Some exceptions are things like depth of table of contents, you can choose how deep you want that to go.
The file /config/_default/languages.</description>
