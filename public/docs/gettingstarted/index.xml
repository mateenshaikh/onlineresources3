        <description>This theme is a little more involved, as my first extension. The recommendations on how to achieve things likely aren&amp;rsquo;t the most efficient all the time but hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll get the job done.
The bar has a listed set of Depth X folders to show how to create nested elements in the menu. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward when you look in the /content menu. Each folder needs a _index.md (which can be created by some other means) in order to render a page.</description>

        <description>To populate content quickly, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to look in /content folder and the appropriate subfolder. If you&amp;rsquo;re creating a new (sub)folder remember to create a new _index.md. If you have several pages in that folder they obviously won&amp;rsquo;t all be named this, but _index.md will be the page that loads when you click on the folder (from the crumbs), you don&amp;rsquo;t directly access it from the menu. If you copy other _index.</description>
